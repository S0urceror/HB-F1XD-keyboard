# HB-F1XD keyboard PCB replacement
The original Sony HB-F1XD MSX2 is an iconic computer from the 80s. Unfortunately time has not served it well. People have forgotten to take out the backup AA batteries. Over time, leakage has spilled into the machine and eaten away parts of the keyboard membrane.

In my case the membrane was beyond repair. I tried with silver ink but after repairing sections other sections broke again.

As a result I painstakingly created a new PCB that is compatible with the old one and supposedly with the rest of the HB-F1 series (not tested).

After building one and selling the initial 8 boards I got break even. Now I am opening up my design for everyone to download, change for personal use only.

## Files
The PCB and schematics are made for KiCAD. In KiCAD you can generate the Gerber files and send them to your PCB manufacturer.

There is also an Afinity Designer file containing the scans of the original membrane.
